This study aims to identify and demonstrate the most optimal methods for forecasting energy market behavior using energy grid data from various zones in the state of New York. The project leverages data from the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) for the years 2019 and 2020. Our goal is to achieve cost reduction and optimal resource allocation for businesses.

Key Findings

Data Analysis: Conducted comprehensive exploratory data analysis and feature engineering to assess the impact of exogenous variables such as temperature, weather conditions, and historical pricing data on energy prices.

Models Tested: Evaluated traditional statistical models (ARMA, SARIMAX) and advanced machine learning algorithms (XGBoost, RNN, LSTM, Transformers).

Ensemble Techniques: Used ensemble techniques to combine predictions from multiple models, enhancing accuracy and robustness.

Performance Evaluation: Models were assessed based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

Optimal Model: The STL and ARIMAX ensemble model emerged as the most effective, providing a significant balance between accuracy and processing time (In sampe MAPE <1.0%).
